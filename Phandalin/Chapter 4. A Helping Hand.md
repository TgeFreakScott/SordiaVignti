After a short rest the party gathered themselves and investigated the area, they found the original body of an older woman, it appeared to be ritual sacrificed. With sadness in their hearts, the went along their way to let the farmer know.

On the way back the party encountered an abnormal looking wolf.
the wolf appeared to be wearing children sized clothing. The party deduced that it was the missing child turned werewolf.
After a few cuts and bruises the Party managed to subdue the werewolf child.
Karrut tried to heal the child, it failed. Now the party had a to rush to town in a hopes a priest could complete the ritual and cure the child.

The party panicked as the reached town, dawn breaking, As they rushed to the Church.
Little did they know Karrut the previous morning had "Hot-Boxed" the church. The ran up to the doors and burst in and called for a cleric or priest. 
A priest responded and was in shock at the sight he saw before him. A Ragged, tired group of adventures with a tied up child sized werewolf.
After a brief explanation the priest agreed to help, "Hurry, to the altar" ~Priest. The priest began a ceremony of healing as Karrut helped with his own "Holy" magic.
After a tense moment, the ceremony was completed but the results were less than perfect.
The child was somewhat cured. They looked like themselves, but with the addition of wolf ears, nose and tail.

The Party went and thanked the priest for their efforts and went to try find the home of the child. As they left the Church, Out of the corner of Ellette's eye she saw two very young children crying over their kitten they found, deceased and tongue-less. Ellette was furious at Karrut, Karrut not knowing any better thought this was endearment.

After re-homing the child, the mother confused but happy with the return of their missing child, proceeded to tell the party about the strange goings on and hooded figures stealing people and keeping the town under a lockdown, nobody dare do anything for fear they were next. "Red Brand" she said a few times. The party recalled of cult activity going on under that guise.
Ellette still furious over the Karrut instance, Tells the party "We wont be leaving here till this is sorted out!, Where the fuck is the Mayor and why isn't that prick doing anything about it?"
The party made there way to the town hall.
