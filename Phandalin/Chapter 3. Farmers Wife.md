The party met the farmer outside of his home, As Ellette went to engage in conversation Karrut wild-shaped into a cow and decided to graze and question the local livestock.
After A short discussion they had a description of the wife and were given her comb, silver with a blue gem. The Farmer had given them a brief direction on where she was last seen, with that they went on their way. 
On there Journey out of town together the party shared some information with each about their personal lives. *Noted in Backstories*.

Along the way they came across an Archaeologist,  A short investigation later they found out his name was **Nib the Explorer** and he was waiting to see if the coast was clear to gather some treasures.
**Nib** asked the party for help gathering treasure, as the party ventured into the ruins with Nib as their side, He got excited and moved forward at a quickened pace.
This revealed a series of zombies, Nib in fear climbed the Ruins of a tower.
Underneath him gathered a pool of zombies, The party had to act quickly to save Nib.
Karrut used his spider-climb abilities to climb the tower and rushed to the location of Nib.
Nib was barely holding on, as Karrut got to Nib, He grabbed Nibs hand and attempted to pull Nib to safety, Unfortunately Nib lost his grip and fell into the zombies.
This caused Nib to perish.
The Party proceeded to kill off the zombies and check for Nib, Nib had passed and was half eaten. The party decided to continue the search for treasure and found a Treasure chest in the ruins. Ellette at first was dubious and untrusting of how clean the chest was. Karrut and Morgar decided to open the chest.
"Oh Shit" ~Karrut
The chest was trapped, it was a mimic. after a short battle the party killed the mic and looted its corpse for a staff, that Karrut claimed as his own.

**Chest Mimic**

Continuing along the path it started to turn dark as it was becoming night. The party entered into a grove with what looked like a ceremonial slab of stone. 
As the party entered a swirl appeared in front of them revealing a spirit, the party tried to communicate with the crying spirit, failing to convince them for a peaceful resolve,
The Spirit turned Banshee and Unleashed a barrage of attacks at the party, Rock was downed, Morgar injured  as Karrut and Ellette barely standing, finished the spirit and collected its voice in a jar.
