Next Morning the party got ready to venture, Karrut was up early and collecting plant supplies, In a fit of confusion cut out a Cats Tongue and placed it in inventory, Ellette was disgusted.
After that incident, Ellette suggested finding a Smith for some gear changes.

After some general introductions the dwarfs name was **Harold**. Ellette and Harold started bartering over a set of daggers. Morgar searched for magical supplies, Rock got himself a new sword, Karrut was happy to be there.

The party then continued to look for additional supplies, The Party noticed some oddly dressed individuals, The Party investigated and followed individuals  who disappeared behind the local church building. The Party lost the leads so decided to continue the supply hunt, Came into a Goods & Services building "Tesco" guarded by a single town guard.
After entering the building they were met with a young woman. 
She was uncaring about the party's presence, Little rude by nature and let the party know if they cause trouble her Boyfriend outside would sort them out quickly. 
Morgar Searched for Magic Books, Purchased One.
Ellette bought Health Potions and Fairy cakes.
Karrut bought Plants, While Rock looked around. 

Unknown to the party the Fairy Cakes contained Faerie dust, Which caused the party to be somewhat drunk and giddy in nature. After a short bout of Inebriation, the party found themselves at the fountain in the town centre, The fountain had a Pink Crystal at the top which glowed. 

A passer-by let them know the crystal kept the town safe from monsters, And also let them know of a poor lonely farmer who's wife had gone missing and a missing child,
The Party decided to investigate.
